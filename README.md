Burger shop is a full-stack project using React for the frontend and Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL for the backend.  

This Repo is associated with the backend to generate a REST API.

The backend has been deployed on Heroku and a live Demo of this project is available [here](https://burger-shop-final-project.netlify.app/)
